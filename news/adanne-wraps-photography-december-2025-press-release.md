Lagos, Nigeria — 5th December 2025 — Melon House Production is pleased to announce the successful wrap of principal photography on ADANNE, its debut feature film. Filming concluded on December 5, 2025, and the project is set to move into post-production in Q1 of 2026.

Written and produced by [Gold Gerry](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm13622353/) and directed by [Orobosa Ikponmwen](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm14759136/).

** LOGLINE: **Three generations of Igbo women battle with love, duty, and family tension as Adanne, caught between youthful creativity and oppressive expectations, fights to claim her own identity and reshape the legacy of her lineage.

ADANNE was shot at select locations in Ibadan, carefully chosen to authentically reflect the emotional and historical realities of the film's timelines. These environments provided a grounded, textured backdrop that enhances the story's intimate and multigenerational scope.

The production highlights the brilliance and collaboration of a skilled technical team led by director [Orobosa Ikponmwen](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm14759136/) and Director of Photography [Olayinka Suara](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12497418/), whose visual approach brings emotional depth, restraint, and cinematic clarity to the film. Their work is supported by a committed crew whose attention to detail and storytelling integrity is evident across every department.

Equally noteworthy is the tenacity of the production team, which successfully organized and completed the entire shoot in under ten days. Under the leadership of [Gold Gerry](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm13622353/) and [Lotanna Nwose](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm16821768/), the team navigated logistical demands with focus and precision, delivering a tightly executed production schedule without compromising creative vision or performance.

With post-production slated for early 2026, ADANNE is planned to begin its journey on the international festival circuit, followed by strategic partnerships with distributors to facilitate theatrical releases.

As the year draws to a close, Melon House Production extends sincere appreciation to its cast, crew, partners, and supporters, and wishes audiences everywhere a Happy New Year filled with meaningful stories, reflection, and hope.

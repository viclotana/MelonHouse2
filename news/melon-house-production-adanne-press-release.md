Lagos, Nigeria — 13th November 2025 — Melon House Production is thrilled to announce ADANNE, a sweeping emotional drama poised for the global festival circuit. Written and Produced by Gold Gerry and directed by Orobosa Ikponmwen, the film offers a profound exploration of motherhood, identity, and the unspoken histories passed down through women.

**LOGLINE:** Three generations of Igbo women battle with love, duty, and family tension as Adanne, caught between youthful creativity and oppressive expectations, fights to claim her own identity and reshape the legacy of her lineage.

Set across three timelines in Eastern Nigeria, Adanne follows Akachi, Ijeoma, and Adanne — women bound by love and burdened by the past. As their stories unfold through mirrored moments of joy, pain, and resilience, the film paints an intimate portrait of how tradition can nurture, protect, and imprison all at once.

With lush cinematography, nuanced performances, and a narrative structure echoing the storytelling traditions of Igbo culture, Adanne bridges local specificity with universal emotional resonance.

"Our society thrives on the culture of silence and silence is what generational cycles need to thrive." says director Orobosa Ikponmwen. "Our mission is simple - break the silence and the wheel, then restart it with something as old as time - understanding and love that meets in the middle."

"Adanne confronts the generational patterns we often refuse to name," says Writer and Producer Gold Gerry. "We wanted to create a film that feels personal and epic at the same time."

Led by Onyinye Odokoro (Ijeoma), Kelvinmary Ndukwe (Daniel), and a multigenerational cast bringing raw authenticity to every frame, Adanne marks Melon House Production's entry into the global filmmaking space.
